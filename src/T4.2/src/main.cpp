/*****************************************************************************
    
    This is a simple vector addition example to demonstrate SDSoC "sys_port"
    feature. SDSoC provides "sys_port" pragma to choose a particular port for
    memory transactions between PL and PS. 

    Note : If no sys_port pragma is specified for an array argument,
    the interface to external memory is determined automatically by the SDSoC
    system compilers, based on array memory attributes (cacheble or non-cacheble)
    , array size, data mover used, etc. This pragma overrides the SDSoC compiler
    choice of memory port. This pragma supports three different ports 
    
            1. ACP - Cache Coherent 
            2. AFI - Non-cache Coherent
            3. MIG (valid for zc706_mem)
